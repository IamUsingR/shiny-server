## User notes for Merz-Wüthrich module

This module represents the Merz-Wüthrich method over both a single period time horizon and over all future time
periods.  This method is explained in Section 4.6.

----------
**A. Input items**

The input box on the left hand side allows the user to enter the following items: 

*1. Data triangle*
This allows the user to select one of six data triangles, as explained in the introduction on the first page of the app' Whenever the selection is changed, the results in the output section on the right hand side are updated immediately.  

The units for the data and results can also be selected, with the default being thousands. 

*2. Select period*

This allows the method to be applied just to a single future period, as in the original formulation of the method; alternatively, the method can be applied to produce the Claims Development ("CDR") result across all future periods. The latter option is explained further in Section 4.6.5, where it is referred to as an extension of the so-called MWCL method over a multi-year time horizon.  The default is over all future periods.

**B. Output items**

The two output items on the right hand side can be selected using the tabbed menu items as follows:

*1. Data and Link Ratios*

This is as per the Chain Ladder module, and is included just for ease of reference.  It shows the selected data triangle in cumulative format and below it the triangle of individual link ratios, along with the simple average link ratio estimator ("smpl") and the column-sum average link ratio estimator ("vwtd"). 

*2. Results*

The results table shows the estimated reserve (on an ultimate basis, not over a single future), the estimated Standard Error (SE) of the CDR and, for comparison purposes, the estimated Standard Error of the reserve, according to Mack's method.  Depending on whether the single or multi-period option is selected the SE of the CDR is shown over either one year, or all future years, broken down by cohort.  However, since the first year SE is shown as the first column of the multi-year option, there is usually no need to use the single-year option.  Using the Reserving book data, the results on a one-period basis will be the same as in the MWCL worked example in Section 4.6.4 (Table 4.61) and on a multi-period basis they will be the same as the extended MWCL method worked example in Section 4.6.5( Table 4.62).
